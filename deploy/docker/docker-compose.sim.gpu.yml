# GPU-accelerated overlay for the sim service.
#
# Requires the NVIDIA container runtime on the host:
#   https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html
#
# Usage (layer on top of the base sim compose file):
#   docker compose -f deploy/docker/docker-compose.sim.yml \
#                  -f deploy/docker/docker-compose.sim.gpu.yml \
#                  run --rm sim bash -c "..."
#
# What this file does:
#   1. Disables the software-rendering env vars set in docker-compose.sim.yml.
#   2. Passes NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES / NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES so the runtime
#      injects libEGL_nvidia.so and libGLX_nvidia.so into the container.
#   3. Reserves the NVIDIA GPU via the Docker Compose device reservation API.
#
# Note: /dev/dri is intentionally NOT passed through.  The original crash
# (segfault in driCreateNewScreen3 / libgallium) was caused by Mesa's gallium
# DRI driver trying to open a DRI render node.  NVIDIA does not use /dev/dri —
# it renders through /dev/nvidia* which the container runtime provides.
# Without /dev/dri, Mesa EGL finds no hardware DRI device and is bypassed;
# OGRE2's EGL device enumeration picks the NVIDIA EGL device instead.

      # mount /dev/dri DRM nodes inside the container.  Mesa EGL then finds
      # those nodes via eglQueryDevicesEXT() and tries to initialise the gallium
      # DRI driver, which segfaults (no GPU kernel module in the container).
      # X11 forwarding works without 'display' — the container is an X11 client
      # connecting to the host X server via the /tmp/.X11-unix socket; DRM
      # master access is handled by the host X server, not the container.
